Micronaut BigQuery Library simplifies usage of [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) from [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/).

The main advantage is decoupling of BigQuery API and allowing easier testing. The library
provides a mock implementation which can be run against any SQL compatible database such as PostgreSQL.
