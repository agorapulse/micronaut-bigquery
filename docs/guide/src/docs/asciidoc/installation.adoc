== Connectiong to Google Cloud

To get started with the library locally you need to setup `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
pointing to the JSON file obtained from Google Cloud Console. Follow the https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries[Quickstart: Using client libraries] tutorial
to get one.

To use the JSON locally for running the application you can add following snippet into your `build.gradle` file:

[source]
----
run {
    environment 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS', file('path/to/credentials.json').absolutePath
}
----

If you are using the library within Google Cloud then BigQuery connection will be configured for you once the BigQuery API is enabled
and configured for the project.
